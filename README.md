# Linux Kernel Module backdoor

A simple proof-of-concept for a kernel backdoor using modules. I made this just out of curiosity and because I wanted to see what kernel development was like. So yes, this is intended **for educational purposes only**.

I'm sure there are hundreads of these on the internet but I wanted to make one from scratch.

Here are some resources I used (in no particular order):

-   https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/
-   https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/
-   https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source
-   https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/refs/heads/master/labs/kernel_modules.html

## Documentation

As this is a working and dangerous piece of software and I want to keep `1337 5cr1p7 k1dd13s` away, I will not explain how to use the software in the repo. If you are experienced enough or have read the above links you will understand how to use this.
